          of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for
          compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms,
          you are prohibited from using or accessing this site. The materials contained in this

        <br /><br />
        2. User Content<br />
        <span class="text-muted"> "User Content" means any and all information and content that a user submits to the

          others that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or endorsed by snip.ml.
          Because you alone are responsible for your User Content, you may expose yourself to
          liability. snip.ml is not obliged to backup any User Content that you post; also, your
          User Content may be deleted at any time without prior notice to you. You are solely
          responsible for making your own backup copies of your User Content if you desire.</span>


        <br /><br />

        3. Acceptable Use Policy<br />
        <span class="text-muted"> The following terms constitute our "Acceptable Use Policy": You agree not to use the
          Site (for example by shortening links) to collect, upload, transmit, display, or
          distribute any User Content (i) that violates any third-party right or any intellectual
          property or proprietary right; (ii) that is unlawful, harassing, abusive, tortious,
          threatening, harmful, invasive of another’s privacy, vulgar, defamatory, false,
          intentionally misleading, trade libelous, pornographic, obscene, patently offensive,
          promotes racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or
          individual; (iii) that is harmful to minors in any way; or (iv) that is in violation of
          any law, regulation, or obligations or restrictions imposed by any third party.
          <br /><br>
          In addition, you agree not to: (i) upload, transmit, or distribute to or through the
          Site any software intended to damage or alter a computer system or data; (ii) send
          through the Site unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk
          mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes, or any other form of duplicative or
          unsolicited messages; (iii) use the Site to harvest, collect, gather or assemble
          information or data regarding other users without their consent; (iv) interfere with,
          disrupt, or create an undue burden on servers or networks connected to the Site, or
          violate the regulations, policies or procedures of such networks; (v) attempt to gain

          attacks or any other means; (vi) harass or interfere with any other user’s use and
          enjoyment of the Site; or (vi) use software or automated agents or scripts that don't
          use the official snip.ml API to produce multiple accounts on the Site, automatically
          shorten links, or to generate automated searches, requests, or queries to the Site.
          <br /><br>
          We reserve the right to review any User Content, and to investigate and/or take
          appropriate action against you in our sole discretion if you violate the Acceptable Use
          Policy or any other provision of these Terms or otherwise create liability for us or any
          other person. Such action may include blocking, removing or modifying your User Content,
          terminating your Account in accordance with Section 8, and/or reporting you to law
          enforcement authorities.
          <br /><br>
          If you provide snip.ml with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Site, you hereby
          assign to snip.ml all rights in such Feedback and agree that snip.ml shall have the
          right to use and fully exploit such Feedback and related information in any manner it
